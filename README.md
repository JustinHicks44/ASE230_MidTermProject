# This is a draft of a website that sells multiple types of tickets, including baseball, football and basketball, including others later on.
# Implemented here are Dynamic and static pages that include a signup page and sign-in page that encrypts passwords and saves them to a JSON file.
# There is an admin page as well that includes the ability to edit, add and delete users.
